# Supermarket-Simulation

# Overall Description:
1.	Product Perspective:
The product in turn is not in continuation or taken from any other products, Its implementation is made possible by the libraries in JAVA building databases in MYSQL and bringing use case and test cases to make the implementation progress run through different arrays of testing. Since the 21st century began people have been invested in using internet and getting their daily needs rather than venturing outside to get something. This Online stationery system allows User to shop the latest stationaries by glancing through an gorgeous GUI to help them navigate around the System from one end to another.
2.	Product Functions:
●	The users/customers will be able to register with a login and password and also entering their pin-code.
●	With the pin-code entered by the users, the users will be provided a particular location where a particular stationery shop would be located so that they can get the materials from nearby stores.
●	Once user logs in they will be able to navigate through the entire shop with just simple clicks, find their desired items and checkout by accessing the payment method option.
●	During their revisit to the online shop in their next order they will be recommended something from their last order they had made so there will be an recommendation based system.
3. User Classes and Characteristics:
 Basic knowledge of using computers is adequate to use this application. Knowledge of how to use a mouse or keyboard and internet browser is necessary. The user interface will be friendly enough to guide the user.
4. Operating Environment:
The software will operate with the following software components and applications:
The software developed will be running under Windows 10 operating system. The hardware that will be running these programs is being developed for this specific project, and will follow the specifications that appear in this document in section 3.

5. Design and Implementation Constraints:
The running of the JAVA & MYSQL Code and database must be handled by operating system 
JAVA Requirements: JDK Above 11 seems suitable for running this.
The device should have certain memory to run it.
Many assumptions had to be made, the learning curve was too steep because had to start from the basics.

6. User Documentation:
For User documentation and requirements pls consult to section 4.

7. Assumptions and Dependencies:
It is assumed that the hardware designed will work correctly with the third-party operating system and the developed software.
